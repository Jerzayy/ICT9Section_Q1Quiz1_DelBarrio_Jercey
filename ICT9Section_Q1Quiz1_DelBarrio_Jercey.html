<center><h1>I want to eat your pancreas</h1>
<p>Movies, not quite fond of them since they proceed the story quite fast with a short amount of time to fill on details. I preferably, would lke to watch series since they add the emotional depth as I get to know the characters more and more I watch the show. But if I were to say that I had a favorite animated movie, I would say I enjoyed the show "I want to eat your Pancreas"</p>
<p>The name itself may sound crazy and concerning, but the title hides a deeper meaning when you watch the movie</p></center>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<u1>
	<li>We start in the perspective of the mc, He is shown to be emotionally distant from others to the point he doesn't even share names with others. Which therefore doesn't give him a specific name to go by (Except of "Boku" which means "Me")</li>
	<li>He later on finds the diary of a girl named Sakura Yamauchi, which is his classmate. In the diary named "Living with Dying" she talks about her terminal panreatic disease (which is not specified what kind of disease, is only mentioned that her pancreas is failing) and her thoughts on dying.</li>
	<li>Sakura found out that he knows of her diary, and told him to keep it a secret from everyone</li>
	<li>She then later on told him to spend time with her and her final moments.</li>
	<li>As they grew to spend time with each other, the mc grows to be more emotionally open to her. Indicating that the mc may have some feelings for her.</li>
	<li>Sakura likes to say "I want to eat your pancreas" due to the belief that if you eat a part of another's body, it can heal your own. This statement explains their reason of meeting and how much they got closer with each other.</li>
	<li>Unexpectedly, before their date in a cafe, Sakura didnt show up. Posing concern to the mc. We later on find out that she was stabbed during an incident, leading to her death </li>
	<li>Afterwards, the mc isolated himself at first, but then learned that no good will happen if he stayed isolaed due to her influence on him.</li>
	<li>The ending shows how much he grew to be more open to others after the incident, changing himself and even mentioning his name (Haruki Shiga) in the end.</li>
